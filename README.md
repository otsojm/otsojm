Welcome!

- 👋 I’m Otso Metsäportti aka otsojm and I'm currently studying information technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (BBA) and 
      in my free time I’m also really passionate to learn more about that field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about subjects like Java, React.js, Node.js, AWS and starting with Python, for example.
- 💞️ I am starting the last year with my studies: last courses during January-May,
internship around May-September and writing thesis at the end of the year.
- 📫 Check contact info and other stuff from my [portfolio page](https://otsojm.github.io/otsojm-portfolio/)!
