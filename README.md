Welcome!

- 👋 I’m Otso Metsäportti aka otsojm and I'm currently studying information technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (BBA) and 
      in my free time I’m also really passionate to learn more about that field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about subjects like Java, React.js, Node.js, AWS and starting with Python, for example.
- 💞️ I’m in the middle of my final year, so I'm looking to do my internship in May 2022 (around 5 months, but it is flexible) --> and keep working after that.
- 📫 Check contact info and other stuff from my [portfolio page](https://otsojm.github.io/otsojm-Portfolio/)!
